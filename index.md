# RECOMB Conference Proceedings

The RECOMB conference series was founded in 1997 to provide a scientific forum for theoretical advances in computational biology and their applications in molecular biology and medicine. The conference solicits research contributions from all areas of computational molecular biology. The origins of the conference came from the mathematical and computational side of the field, and there remains a focus on computational advances. In addition, the effective use of computational techniques in biological discovery is also an important aspect of the conference. For more about our history, see our [history page](https://recomb.org/history/), [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@recombconf), or [Google Photo Albums](https://sites.google.com/view/recombconferences).

## The RECOMB Publication Lifecycle

This page serves as a central directory for all RECOMB publications. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive listing that connects a paper's initial preprint, its official proceedings version, and its final journal publication all in one place.

### Our Review Process

Every paper submitted to RECOMB undergoes a rigorous peer-review process, with each submission being evaluated by at least three reviewers.

### From Proceedings to Journal Publication

Authors of accepted papers have multiple avenues for publication:

- Conference Proceedings: All papers accepted after the review process are published in the official RECOMB conference proceedings. Papers that are ultimately published in journals, except those appear in *Journal of Computational Biology*, are included in the conference proceedings only as extended abstracts. 
- Journal Partnership: RECOMB maintains partnerships with leading journals. Accepted papers are eligible for publication in one of our partners after an additional editorial screening process. Authors may wish to submit to other journals, but our current partners are:
  - Cell Systems
  - Genome Research 
  - Journal of Computational Biology
- Preprints: We strongly encourage all authors to submit their work to preprint servers (such as bioRxiv or arXiv).
