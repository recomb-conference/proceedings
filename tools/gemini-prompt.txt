The TSV file I uploaded includes a list of papers published in the RECOMB 2023 Conference. The BIB file is a collective bibliography of RECOMB conferences that covers about 20 years. Each paper in RECOMB may have different citations; a proceedings citation in Springer LNCS series, a bioRxiv version, an arXiv version, and a journal version. The journal version is more likely to be Cell Systems, Genome Research, or Journal for Computational Biology, but it could be in another journal. There is no rule that a paper appears in all of these, but it would appear in some of these. Use the BIB file and Web Search to find each different version of each paper. The journal versions may have a slightly different name and different author orderings, even additional authors. Tabulate your findings, return with these additional columns for each paper: 

Preprint: This should be bioRxiv ID, arXiv ID
Journal name: Name of the journal the paper is published in.
Title in the journal version 
Journal volume issue and pages
Journal publication year
