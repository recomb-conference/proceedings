The TSV file I uploaded includes a list of papers published in the RECOMB 2023 Conference. The BIB file is a collective bibliography of RECOMB conferences that covers about 20 years. Each paper in RECOMB may have different citations; a proceedings citation in Springer LNCS series, a bioRxiv version, an arXiv version, and a journal version. The journal version is more likely to be Cell Systems, Genome Research, or Journal for Computational Biology, but it could be in another journal. There is no rule that a paper appears in all of these, but it would appear in some of these. Use the BIB file and Web Search to find each different version of each paper. The journal versions may have a slightly different name and different author orderings, even additional authors. Tabulate your findings, return with these additional columns for each paper: 

Preprint: This should be bioRxiv ID, arXiv ID. Do not add the full DOI, return bioRxiv in a format like "bioRxiv 2020.01.17.910513", and arXiv in a format like "arXiv:1907.01458"
Journal name: Name of the journal the paper is published in.
Title in the journal version 
Journal authors: Names of the authors in the journal version.
Journal volume issue and pages
Journal publication year
Journal version DOI.  


Gemini 3 corrections:

your table did not follow instructions. I asked for you to provide the full author lists, do not use the "et al.". The Original Authors and the Journal Version Authors should be separated to two different columns, and again do not use "et al". You did not provide the preprint information as I asked, add the bioRxiv or arXiv information for each paper, and leave as NA if you cannot find those. Provide full journal citation, not just the name and the year. For the journal DOI do not just cite the files I provided it to you, give the full DOI for those papers. Also the titles in journal versions are wrong - you hallucinated a lot. For example, the journal version title of the first one DOI for the first line must be Joint Analysis of Long and Short Reads Enables Accurate Estimates of Microbiome Complexity; it is published at Cell Systems, 7(2): 192-200 in 2018. Its DOI is  10.1016/j.cels.2018.06.009. Follow my instructions completely and generate a correct table with no hallucinations

Consolidate all of the results into one sheet. Also add the IDs for bioRxiv and arXiv preprints, most of them are missing. Those should be like "bioRxiv 220236"
